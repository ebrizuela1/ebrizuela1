# üíª Edgar Brizuela

**üéì Computer Science Student @ [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/)** | **Expected Graduation: December 2026**

I'm a passionate developer dedicated to building impactful, accessible technology. My core focus is on **full-stack development** and leveraging data structures, algorithms, and systems programming to solve real-world problems.

I have professional experience developing a **Gemini LLM** to support efficient grant-making decisions and implementing screening tools with **Firebase**. I also have experience as a **Programming Practicum Teaching Assistant** at UIC. I'm currently seeking a **Software Engineering Internship** for Summer 2026.
